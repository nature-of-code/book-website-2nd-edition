<h2 id="reinforcement-learning-1">Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<p>There is so much more to working with data, machine learning, ml5.js, and beyond. I’ve only scratched the surface. As I close out this book, my goal is to tie the foundational machine learning concepts I’ve covered back into animated, interactive p5.js sketches that simulate physics and complex systems. Let’s see if I can bring as many concepts from the entire book back together for one last hurrah!</p>
<p>Towards the start of this chapter, I referenced an approach to incorporating machine learning into a simulated environment called “reinforcement learning.” Imagine embedding a neural network into any of the example objects (walker, mover, particle, vehicle) and calculating a force or some other action. The neural network could receive inputs related to the environment (such as distance to an obstacle) and produce a decision that requires a choice from a set of discrete options (e.g., move “left” or “right”) or a set of continuous values (e.g., magnitude and direction of a steering force). This is starting to sound familiar: it’s a neural network that receives inputs and performs classification or regression!</p>
<p>Here is where things take a turn, however. To better illustrate the concept, let’s start with a hopefully easy to understand and possibly familiar scenario, the game “Flappy Bird.” The game is deceptively simple. You control a small bird that continually moves horizontally across the screen. With each tap or click, the bird flaps its wings and rises upward. The challenge? A series of vertical pipes spaced apart at irregular intervals emerges from the right. The pipes have gaps, and your primary objective is to navigate the bird safely through these gaps. If you hit one, it’s game over. As you progress, the game’s speed increases, and the more pipes you navigate, the higher your score.</p>

</figure>
<p>Suppose you wanted to automate the gameplay, and instead of a human tapping, a neural network will make the decision as to whether to “flap” or not. Could machine learning work here? Skipping over the “data” steps for a moment, let’s think about “choosing a model.” What are the inputs and outputs of the neural network?</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the inputs. This is quite the intriguing question because there isn’t a definitive answer! In a scenario where you want to see if you could train an automated neural network player without any knowledge of the game itself, it might make the most sense to have the inputs be all the pixels of the game screen. Maybe you don’t want to put your thumb on the scale in terms of what aspects of the game are important. This approach attempts to feed <em>everything</em> about the game into the model.</p>
<p>For me, I understand the flappy bird game quite well, I believe I can identify the important data points needed to make a decision. I can bypass all the pixels and boil the essence of the game down into the important <strong>features </strong>that define the game. Remember the discussion about features in the context of the gesture classifier? It applies here as well. These features are not arbitrary aspects of the game; they represent the distinct characteristics of Flappy Bird that are most salient for the neural network's decisions.</p>
<ol>
  <li><span data-type="equation">y</span> position of the bird</li>
  <li><span data-type="equation">y</span> velocity of the bird.</li>
  <li><span data-type="equation">y</span> position of the next pipe’s top opening.</li>
  <li><span data-type="equation">y</span> position of the next pipe’s bottom opening.</li>
  <li><span data-type="equation">x</span> distance to the next pipes.</li>
</ol>

</figure>
<p>These are the inputs to the neural network. But what about the outputs? Is the problem a "classification" or "regression" one? This may seem like an odd question to ask in the context of a game like Flappy Bird, but it's actually incredibly important and relates to how the game is controlled. Tapping the screen, pressing a button, or using keyboard controls are all examples of classification. After all, there is only a discrete set of choices: tap or not, press 'w', 'a', 's', or 'd' on the keyboard. On the other hand, using an analog controller like a joystick leans towards regression. A joystick can be tilted in varying degrees in any direction, translating to continuous output values for both its horizontal and vertical axes.</p>
<p>For flappy bird, it’s a classification decision with only two choices:</p>
<ol>
  <li>flap</li>
  <li>don’t flap</li>
</ol>

  <figcaption>Figure 10.22: The neural network as ml5.js might design it</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This gives me the information needed to choose the model and I can let ml5.js build it.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">let options = {
  inputs: 5,
  outputs: ["flap", "no flap"]
}
let birdBrain = ml5.neuralNetwork(options);</pre>
<p>Now if I were to continue this line of thinking further, I’d have to go back to steps 1 and 2 of the machine learning process: data collection and preparation. How exactly would that work here? One idea would be to scour the earth for the greatest flappy bird player of all time and record them playing for hours. I could log all of the input features for every moment of gameplay along with whether the player flapped or not. Feed all that data into the model, train it, and I can see the headlines already: “Artificial Intelligence Bot Defeats Flappy Bird.”</p>
<p>But um, wait a second here, has an agent really learned to play Flappy Bird on its own or has it really just learned to mirror the play of a human? What if that human missed a key aspect of flappy bird strategy? The automated player would never discover it. Not to mention the fact that collecting all that data would be an incredibly tedious and laborious process.</p>
<p>This is where reinforcement learning comes in. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns through interacting with the environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Unlike supervised learning, where the “correct” answers are provided by a training dataset, the agent in reinforcement learning learns the answers, the optimal decisions, through trial and error. For example, in Flappy Bird, the bird could receive a positive reward every time it successfully navigates a pipe, but a negative reward if it hits a pipe or the ground. The agent's goal is to figure out which actions lead to the most cumulative rewards over time.</p>
<p>At the start, the Flappy Bird agent won't know the best time to flap its wings, leading to many crashes. But as it accrues more and more feedback from countless play-throughs, it begins to refine its actions and develop the optimal strategy to navigate the pipes without crashing, maximizing its total reward. This process of "learning by doing" and optimizing based on feedback is the essence of reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>In the next section, I'll explore the principles I’m outlining here with a twist. Traditional techniques in reinforcement learning involve defining something called a “policy” and a corresponding “reward function.” Instead of going down this road, however, I will introduce a related technique that is baked into ml5.js: <strong>neuroevolution. </strong>This technique combines the evolutionary algorithms from Chapter 9 with neural networks. By evolving the weights of a neural network, I’ll demonstrate how the bird can perfect its journey through the pipes! I'll then finish off the chapter with a variation of Craig Reynold's steering behaviors from Chapter 5 using neuroevolution.</p>
<h2 id="evolving-neural-networks-is-neat-1">Evolving Neural Networks is NEAT!</h2>
<p>Instead of traditional backpropagation to train the weights in a neural network, neuroevolution applies principles of genetic algorithms and natural selection: the best-performing neural networks are "selected" and their "genes" (or weights) are combined and mutated to create the next generation of networks.</p>
<p>One of the first examples of neuroevolution can be found in the 1994 paper "<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.56.3139">Genetic Lander: An experiment in accurate neuro-genetic control</a>" by Edmund Ronald and Marc Schoenauer. In the 1990s traditional neural network training methods were still nascent, and this work explored an alternative approach. The paper describes how a simulated spacecraft—in a game aptly named "Lunar Lander"—can learn how to safely descend and land on a surface. Rather than use hand-crafted rules or labeled datasets, the researchers opted for genetic algorithms to evolve and train neural networks over multiple generations. And it worked!</p>
<p>In 2002, Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen expanded on earlier neuroevolutionary approaches with their paper titled "<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/evco/article-abstract/10/2/99/1123/Evolving-Neural-Networks-through-Augmenting?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Evolving Neural Networks Through Augmenting Topologies</a>." Unlike the lunar lander method that focused on evolving the weights of a neural network, Stanley and Miikkulainen introduced a method that also evolved the network's structure itself! The “NEAT” algorithm—NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies—starts with simple networks and progressively refines their topology through evolution. As a result, NEAT can discover network architectures tailored to specific tasks, often yielding more optimized and effective solutions.</p>
<p>A comprehensive NEAT implementation would require going deeper into the neural network architecture with TensorFlow.js directly. My goal here is to emulate Ronald and Schoenauer’s research in the modern context of the web browser with ml5.js. Rather than use the lunar lander game, I’ll give this a try with Flappy Bird!</p>
<h2 id="coding-flappy-bird-1">Coding Flappy Bird</h2>
<p>The game Flappy Bird was created by Vietnamese game developer Dong Nguyen in 2013. In January 2014, it became the most downloaded app on the Apple App Store. However, on February 8th, Nguyen announced that he was removing the game due to its addictive nature. Since then, it has been one of the most cloned games in history. Flappy Bird is a perfect example of "Nolan's Law," an aphorism attributed to the founder of Atari and creator of Pong, Nolan Bushnell: "All the best games are easy to learn and difficult to master.”</p>
<p>Flappy Bird is also a terrific game for beginner coders to recreate as a learning exercise, and it fits perfectly with the concepts in this book. To create the game with p5.js, I’ll start with by defining a <code>Bird</code> class. Now, I’m going to do something that may shock you here, but I’m going to skip using <code>p5.Vector</code> for this demonstration and instead use separate <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties for the bird’s position. Since the bird only moves along the vertical axis in the game, <code>x</code> remains constant! Therefore, the <code>velocity</code> (and all of the relevant forces) can be a single scalar value for just the y-axis. To simplify things even further, I’ll add the forces directly to the bird's velocity instead of accumulating them into an acceleration variable. In addition to the usual <code>update()</code>, I’ll include a <code>flap()</code> method for the bird to fly upward. The <code>show()</code> method is not included below as it remains the same and draws only a circle.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">class Bird {
  constructor() {
    // The bird's position (x will be constant)
    this.x = 50
    this.y = 120;

    // Velocity and forces are scalar since the bird only moves along the y-axis
    this.velocity = 0;
    this.gravity = 0.5;
    this.flapForce = -10;
  }

  // The bird flaps its wings
  flap() {
    this.velocity += this.flapForce;
  }

  update() {
    // Add gravity
    this.velocity += this.gravity;
    this.y += this.velocity;
    // Dampen velocity
    this.velocity *= 0.95;

    // Handle the "floor"
    if (this.y > height) {
      this.y = height;
      this.velocity = 0;
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>The other primary element of the game are the pipes that the bird must navigate through. I’ll create a <code>Pipe</code> class to describe a pair of rectangles, one that emanates from the top of the canvas and one from the bottom. Just as the bird only moves vertically, the pipes slide along only the horizontal axis, so the properties can also be scalar values rather than vectors. The pipes move at a constant speed and don’t experience any physics.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">class Pipe {
  constructor() {
    // The size of the opening between the two parts of the pipe
    this.spacing = 100;
    // A random height for the top of the pipe
    this.top = random(height - this.spacing);
    // The starting position of the bottom pipe (based on the top)
    this.bottom = this.top + this.spacing;
    // The pipe starts at the edge of the canvas
    this.x = width;
    // Width of the pipe
    this.w = 20;
    // Horizontal speed of the pipe
    this.velocity = 2;
  }
	
  // Draw the two pipes
  show() {
    fill(0 );
    noStroke();
    rect(this.x, 0, this.w, this.top);
    rect(this.x, this.bottom, this.w, height - this.bottom);
  }

  // Update the pipe horizontal position
  update() {
    this.x -= this.velocity;
  }
}</pre>
<p>To be clear, the "reality" depicted in the game is a bird flying through pipes. The bird is moving along two dimensions while the pipes remain stationary. However, it is simpler in terms of code to consider the bird as stationary in its horizontal position and treat the pipes as moving.</p>
<p>With a <code>Bird</code> and <code>Pipe</code> class written, I'm almost set to run the game. However, there remains a key missing piece: collisions. The whole game rides on the bird attempting to avoid the pipes! This is nothing new, you’ve seen many examples of objects checking their positions against others throughout this book.</p>
<p>Now, there's a design choice to make. A function to check collisions could logically be placed in either the <code>Bird</code> class (to check if the bird hits a pipe) or in the <code>Pipe</code> class (to check if a pipe hits the bird). Either can be justified depending on your point of view. I'll place it in the <code>Pipe</code> class and call it <code>collides()</code>.</p>
<p>It's a little trickier than you might think on first glance as the function needs to check both the top and bottom rectangles of a pipe against the position of the bird. There are a variety of ways you could approach this, one way is to first check if the bird is vertically within the bounds of either rectangle (either above the top pipe or below the bottom one). But it's only actually colliding with the pipe if the bird is also horizontally within the boundaries of the pipe's width. An elegant way to write this is to combining each of these checks with a logical "and."</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  collides(bird) {
    // Is the bird within the vertical range of the top or bottom pipe?
    let verticalCollision = bird.y &#x3C; this.top || bird.y > this.bottom;
    // Is the bird within the horizontal range of the pipes?
    let horizontalCollision = bird.x > this.x &#x26;&#x26; bird.x &#x3C; this.x + this.w;
    //{!1} If it's both a vertical and horizontal hit, it's a hit!
    return verticalCollision &#x26;&#x26; horizontalCollision;
  }</pre>
<p>The algorithm currently treats the bird as a single point and does not take into account its size. This is something that should be improved for a more realistic version of the game.</p>
<p>All that’s left to do is write <code>setup()</code> and <code>draw()</code>. I need a single variable for the bird and an array for a list of pipes. The interaction is just a single press of the mouse. Rather than build a fully functional game with a score, end screen, and other usual elements, I’ll just make sure things are working by drawing the text “OOPS!” near any pipe when there is a collision. The code also assumes an additional <code>offscreen()</code> method to the <code>Pipe</code> class for when it has moved beyond the left edge of the canvas.</p>

  pipes.push(new Pipe());

  //{!3} Add a new pipe every 75 frames
  if (frameCount % 75 == 0) {

  }
}</pre>
<p>The trickiest aspect of the above code lies in spawning the pipes at regular intervals with the <code>frameCount</code> variable and modulo operator <code>%</code>. In p5.js, <code>frameCount</code> is a system variable that tracks the number of frames rendered since the sketch began, incrementing with each cycle of the <code>draw()</code> loop. The modulo operator, denoted by <code><strong>%</strong></code>, returns the remainder of a division operation. For example, <code>7 % 3</code> would yield <code>1</code> because when dividing 7 by 3, the result is 2 with a remainder of 1. The boolean expression <code>frameCount % 75 == 0</code> therefore checks if the current <code>frameCount</code> value, when divided by 75, has a remainder of 0. This condition is true every 75 frames and at those frame counts, a new pipe is spawned and added to the <code>pipes</code> array.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="neuroevolution-flappy-bird-1">Neuroevolution Flappy Bird</h2>
<p>The game, as it currently stands, is controlled by mouse clicks. The first step to implementing neuroevolution is to give each bird a brain so that it can decide on its own whether or not to flap its wings.</p>
<h3 id="the-bird-brain-1">The Bird Brain</h3>
<p>In the previous section on reinforcement learning, I established a list of input features that comprise the bird's decision-making process. I’m going to use that same list with one simplification. Since the size of the opening between the pipes will remain constant, there’s no need to include both the <span data-type="equation">y</span> positions of the top and bottom; one will suffice.</p>
<ol>
  <li><span data-type="equation">y</span> position of the bird.</li>
  <li><span data-type="equation">y</span> velocity of the bird.</li>
  <li><span data-type="equation">y</span> position of the next pipe’s top (or the bottom!) opening.</li>
  <li><span data-type="equation">x</span> distance to the next pipes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The outputs have just two options: to flap or not to flap! With the inputs and outputs set, I can add a <code>brain</code> property to the bird’s constructor with the appropriate configuration. Just to demonstrate a different style here, I’ll skip including a separate <code>options</code> variable and pass the properties as an object literal directly into the <code>ml5.neuralNetwork()</code> function. Note the addition of a <code>neuroEvolution</code> property set to <code>true</code>. This is necessary to enable some of the features I’ll be using later in the code.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  constructor() {
    this.brain = ml5.neuralNetwork({
      // A bird's brain receives 4 inputs and classifies them into one of two labels
      inputs: 4,
      outputs: ["flap", "no flap"],
      task: "classification",
      //{!1} A new property necessary to enable neuro evolution functionality
      neuroEvolution: true
    });
  }</pre>
<p>Next, I’ll add a new method called <code>think()</code> to the <code>Bird</code> class where all of the necessary inputs for the bird are calculated. The first two are easy, as they are simply the <code>y</code> and <code>velocity</code> properties of the bird itself. However, for inputs 3 and 4, I need to determine which pipe is the “next” pipe.</p>
<p>At first glance, it might seem that the next pipe is always the first one in the array, since the pipes are added one at a time to the end of the array. However, once a pipe passes the bird, it is no longer relevant. I need to find the first pipe in the array whose right edge (x-position plus width) is greater than the bird’s x position.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  think(pipes) {
    let nextPipe = null;
    for (let pipe of pipes) {
      //{!4} The next pipe is the one who hasn't passed the bird yet.
      if (pipe.x + pipe.w > this.x) {
        nextPipe = pipe;
        break;
      }
    }</pre>
<p>Once I have the next pipe, I can create the four inputs:</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">    let inputs = [
      // y-position of bird
      this.y,
      // y-velocity of bird
      this.velocity,
      // top opening of next pipe
      nextPipe.top,
      //{!1} distance from next pipe to this pipe
      nextPipe.x - this.x,
    ];</pre>
<p>However, I have forgotten a critical step! The range of all input values is determined by the dimensions of the canvas. The neural network, however, expects values in a standardized range, such as 0 to 1. One method to normalize these values is to divide the inputs related to vertical properties by<code>height</code>, and those related to horizontal ones by <code>width</code>.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">    let inputs = [
      //{!4} All of the inputs are now normalized by width and height
      this.y / height,
      this.velocity / height,
      nextPipe.top / height,
      (nextPipe.x - this.x) / width,
    ];</pre>
<p>With the inputs in hand, I’m ready to pass them to the neural network’s <code>classify()</code> method. There is, however, one small problem. Remember, <code>classify()</code> is asynchronous! This means I need implement a callback inside the <code>Bird</code> class to process the decision! Unfortunately, doing so adds a level of complexity to the code here which is entirely unnecessary. Asynchronous callbacks with machine learning functions in ml5.js are typically necessary due to the time required to process a large amount of data in a model. Without a callback, the code might have to wait a long time and if it’s in the context of a p5.js animation, it could severely impact the smoothness of any animation. The neural network here, however, only has four floating point inputs and two output labels! It’s tiny and can run so fast there’s no reason to implement this asynchronously.</p>
<p>For completeness, I will include a version of the example on this book’s website that implements neuroevolution with asynchronous callbacks. For the discussion here, however, I’m going to use a feature of ml5.js that allows me to take a shortcut. The method <code>classifySync()</code> is identical to <code>classify()</code>, but it runs synchronously, meaning that the code stops and waits for the results before moving on. You should be very careful when using this version of the method as it can cause problems in other contexts, but it will work well for this scenario. Here is the end of the <code>think()</code> method with <code>classifySync()</code>.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">    let results = this.brain.classifySync(inputs);
    if (results[0].label == "flap") {
      this.flap();
    }
  }</pre>
<p>The neural network's prediction is in the same format as the gesture classifier and the decision can be made by checking the first element of the <code>results</code> array. If the output label is <code>"flap"</code>, then call <code>flap()</code>.</p>
<p>Now is where the real challenge begins: teaching the bird to win the game and flap its wings at the right moment! Recalling the discussion of genetic algorithms from Chapter 9, there are three key principles that underpin Darwinian evolution: <strong>Variation</strong>, <strong>Selection</strong>, and <strong>Heredity</strong>. Let’s go through each of these principles, implementing all the steps of the genetic algorithm itself with neural networks.</p>
<h3 id="variation-a-flock-of-flappy-birds-1">Variation: A Flock of Flappy Birds</h3>
<p>A single bird with a randomly initialized neural network isn’t likely to have any success at all. That lone bird will most likely jump incessantly and fly way offscreen or sit perched at the bottom of the canvas awaiting collision after collision with the pipes. This erratic and nonsensical behavior is a reminder: a randomly initialized neural network lacks any knowledge or experience! The bird is essentially making wild guesses for its actions and success is going to be very rare.</p>
<p>This is where the first key principle of genetic algorithms comes in: <strong>variation</strong>. The hope is that by introducing as many different neural network configurations as possible, a few might perform slightly better than the rest. The very first step towards variation is to add an array of many birds.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">// Population size
let populationSize = 200;
// Array of birds
let birds = [];

function setup() {
  //{!3} Create the bird population
  for (let i = 0; i &#x3C; populationSize; i++) {
    birds[i] = new Bird();
  }
	
  //{!1} Run the computations on the "cpu" for better performance
  ml5.setBackend("cpu");
}

function draw() {
  for (let bird of birds) {
    //{!1} This is the new method for the bird to make a decision to flap or not
    bird.think(pipes);
    bird.update();
    bird.show();
  }
}</pre>
<p>You might notice a peculiar line of code that's crept into setup: <code>ml5.setBackend("cpu")</code>. When running neural networks, a lot of the heavy computational lifting is often offloaded to the GPU. This is the default behavior, and especially critical for larger pre-trained models included as part of ml5.js.</p>
<div data-type="note">
  <h3 id="gpu-vs-cpu-1">GPU vs. CPU</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</strong>: Originally designed for rendering graphics, GPUs are adept at handling a massive number of operations in parallel. This makes them excellent for the kind of math operations and computations that machine learning models frequently perform.</li>
    <li><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</strong>: Often considered the "brain" or general-purpose heart of a computer, a CPU handles a wider variety of tasks than the specialized GPU.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>But there's a catch! Transferring data to and from the GPU introduces some overhead. In most cases, the gains from the GPU's parallel processing offset this overhead. However, for such a tiny model like the one here, copying data to the GPU and back slows things down more than it helps.</p>
<p>This is where <code>ml5.setBackend("cpu")</code> comes in. By specifying <code>"cpu"</code>, the neural network computations will instead run on the “Central Processing Unit” —the general-purpose heart of your computer— which handles the operations more efficiently for a population of many tiny bird brains.</p>
<h3 id="selection-flappy-bird-fitness-1">Selection: Flappy Bird Fitness</h3>
<p>Once I’ve got a diverse population of birds, each with their own neural network, the next step in the genetic algorithm is <strong>selection</strong>. Which birds should pass on their genes (in this case, neural network weights) to the next generation? In the world of Flappy Bird, the measure of success is the ability to stay alive the longest avoiding the pipes. This is the bird's "fitness." A bird that dodges many pipes is considered more "fit" than one that crashes into the first one it encounters.</p>
<p>To track the bird’s fitness, I am going to add two properties to the <code>Bird</code> class: <code>fitness</code> and <code>alive</code>.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  constructor() {
    // The bird's fitness
    this.fitness = 0;
    //{!1} Keeping track if the bird is alive or not
    this.alive = true;
  }</pre>
<p>I’ll assign the fitness a numeric value that increases by 1 every cycle through <code>draw()</code>, as long as the bird remains alive. The birds that survive longer should have a higher fitness.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  update() {
    //{!1} Incrementing the fitness each time through update
    this.fitness++;
  }</pre>
<p>The <code>alive</code> property is a <code>boolean</code> flag that is initially set to <code>true</code>. However, when a bird collides with a pipe, it is set to <code>false</code>. Only birds that are still alive are updated and drawn to the canvas.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">function draw() {
  // There are now an array of birds!
  for (let bird of birds) {
    //{!1} Only operate on the birds that are still alive
    if (bird.alive) {
      // Make a decision based on the pipes
      bird.think(pipes);
      // Update and show the bird
      bird.update();
      bird.show();

      //{!4} Has the bird hit a pipe? If so, it's no longer alive.
      for (let pipe of pipes) {  
        if (pipe.collides(bird)) {
          bird.alive = false;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>In Chapter 9, I demonstrated two techniques for running an evolutionary simulation. The first involved a population living for a fixed amount of time each generation. The same approach would likely work here as well, but I want to allow the birds to accumulate the highest fitness possible and not arbitrarily stop them based on a time limit. The second technique, demonstrated with the "bloops" example, involved eliminating the fitness score entirely and setting a random probability for cloning alive birds. However, this approach could become messy and risks overpopulation or all the birds dying out completely. Instead, I propose combining elements of both approaches. I will allow a generation to continue as long as at least one bird is still alive. When all the birds have died, I will select parents for the reproduction step and start anew.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by writing a function to check if all the birds have died.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">function allBirdsDead() {
  for (let bird of birds) {
    //{!3} If a single bird is alive, they are not all dead!
    if (bird.alive) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  //{!1} If the loop completes without finding a living bird, they are all dead
  return true;
}</pre>
<p>When all the birds have died, then it’s time for selection! In the previous genetic algorithm examples I demonstrated a technique for giving a fair shot to all members of a population, but increasing the chances of selection for those with higher fitness scores. I’ll use that same <code>weightedSelection()</code> function here.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">//{!1} See chapter 9 for a detailed explanation of this algorithm
function weightedSelection() {
  let index = 0;
  let start = random(1);
  while (start > 0) {
    start = start - birds[index].fitness;
    index++;
  }
  index--;
  //{!1} Instead of returning the entire Bird object, just the brain is returned
  return birds[index].brain;
}</pre>
<p>However, for this algorithm to function properly, I need to first normalize the fitness values of the birds so that they collectively sum to 1. This way, each bird's fitness is equal to its probability of being selected.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">function normalizeFitness() {
  // Sum the total fitness of all birds
  let sum = 0;
  for (let bird of birds) {
    sum += bird.fitness;
  }
  //{!3} Divide each bird's fitness by the sum
  for (let bird of birds) {
    bird.fitness = bird.fitness / sum;
  }
}</pre>
<h3 id="heredity-baby-birds-1">Heredity: Baby Birds</h3>
<p>There’s only one step left in the genetic algorithm—reproduction. In Chapter 9, I explored in great detail the two step process for generating a “child” element: crossover and mutation. Crossover is where the third key principle of <strong>heredity</strong> arrives. After selecting the DNA of two parents, they are combined to form the child’s DNA. At first glance, the idea of inventing an algorithm for crossover of two neural networks might seem daunting. Yet, it’s actually quite straightforward. Think of the individual “genes” of a bird’s brain to be the weights within the network. Mixing two such brains boils down to creating a new neural network, where each weight is chosen by a virtual coin flip—picking a value from the first or second parent.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">// Picking two parents and creating a child with crossover
let parentA = weightedSelection();
let parentB = weightedSelection();
let child = parentA.crossover(parentB);</pre>
<p>As you can see, today is my lucky day, as ml5.js includes a <code>crossover()</code> that manages the algorithm for mixing the two neural networks. I can happily move onto the mutation step.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">// Mutating the child
child.mutate(0.01);</pre>
<p>The ml5.js library also provides a <code>mutate()</code> method that accepts a "mutation rate" as its primary argument. The rate determines how often a weight will be altered. For example, a rate of 0.01 indicates a 1% chance that any given weight will mutate. During mutation, ml5.js adjusts the weight slightly by adding a small random number to it, rather than selecting a completely new random value. This behavior mimics real-world genetic mutations, which typically introduce minor changes rather than entirely new traits. Although this default approach works for many cases, ml5.js offers more control over the process by allowing the use of a "custom" function as an optional second argument to <code>mutate()</code>.</p>
<p>These crossover and mutation steps are repeated for the size of the population to create an entire new generation of birds. This is accomplished by populating an empty local array <code>nextBirds</code> with the new birds. Once the population is full, the global <code>birds</code> array is then updated to this fresh generation.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">function reproduction() {
  //{!1} Start with a new empty array
  let nextBirds = [];
  for (let i = 0; i &#x3C; populationSize; i++) {
    // Pick 2 parents
    let parentA = weightedSelection();
    let parentB = weightedSelection();
    // Create a child with crossover
    let child = parentA.crossover(parentB);
    // Apply mutation
    child.mutate(0.01);
    //{!1} Create the new bird object
    nextBirds[i] = new Bird(child);
  }
  //{!1} The next generation is now the current one!
  birds = nextBirds;
}</pre>
<p>If you look closely at the <code>reproduction()</code> function, you may notice that I’ve slipped in another new feature of the <code>Bird</code> class, specifically an argument to the constructor. When I first introduced the idea of a bird “brain,” each new <code>Bird</code> object was created with a brand new brain—a fresh neural network courtesy of ml5.js. However, I now want the new birds to “inherit” a child brain that was generated through the processes of crossover and mutation.</p>
<p>To make this possible, I’ll subtly change the <code>Bird</code> constructor to look for an “optional” argument named, of course, <code>brain</code>.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  constructor(brain) {
    //{!1} Check if a brain was passed in
    if (brain) {
      this.brain = brain;
    //{!1} If not, proceed as usual
    } else {
      this.brain = ml5.neuralNetwork({
        inputs: 4,
        outputs: ["flap", "no flap"],
        task: "classification",
        neuroEvolution: true,
      });
    }
  }</pre>
<p>Here’s the magic, if no <code>brain</code> is provided when a new bird is created, the <code>brain</code> argument remains <code>undefined</code>. In JavaScript, <code>undefined</code> is treated as <code>false</code> and so the code moves on to the <code>else</code> and calls <code>ml5.neuralNetwork()</code>. On the other hand, if I I do pass in an existing neural network, <code>brain</code> evaluates to <code>true</code> and is assigned directly to <code>this.brain</code>. This elegant trick allows the constructor to handle different scenarios.</p>
<p>And with that, the example is complete. All that is left to do is call <code>normalizeFitness()</code> and <code>reproduction()</code> in <code>draw()</code> at the end of each generation when all the birds have died out.</p>

<h2 id="steering-the-neuroevolutionary-way-1">Steering the Neuroevolutionary Way</h2>
<p>Having explored neuroevolution with Flappy Bird, I’d like to shift the focus back to the realm of simulation, specifically the steering agents introduced in chapter 5. What if, instead of dictating the rules for an algorithm to calculate a steering force, a simulated creature could evolve its own strategy? Drawing inspiration from Craig Reynolds’ aim of “life-like and improvisational” behaviors, my goal is not to use neuroevolution to engineer the perfect creature that can flawlessly execute a task. Instead, I hope to create a captivating world of simulated life, where the quirks, nuances, and happy accidents of evolution unfold in the canvas.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with adapting the Smart Rockets example from Chapter 9. In that example, the genetic code for each rocket was an array of vectors.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">this.genes = [];
for (let i = 0; i &#x3C; lifeSpan; i++) {
  //{!2} Each gene is a vector with random direction and magnitude
  this.genes[i] = p5.Vector.random2D();
  this.genes[i].mult(random(0, this.maxforce));
}</pre>
<p>I propose adapting the above to instead use a neural network to "predict" the vector or steering force, transforming the <code>genes</code> into a <code>brain</code>.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">this.brain = ml5.neuralNetwork({
  inputs: 2,
  outputs: 2,
  task: "regression",
  neuroEvolution: true,
});</pre>
<p>But what are the inputs and outputs? In the original example, the vectors from the <code>genes</code> array were applied sequentially, querying the array with a <code>counter</code> variable.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">this.applyForce(this.genes[this.counter]);</pre>
<p>Now, instead of an array lookup, I want the neural network to return a vector with <code>predictSync()</code>.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">// Get the outputs from the neural network
let outputs = this.brain.predictSync(inputs);
// Use one output for an angle
let angle = outputs[0].value * TWO_PI;
// Use another outputs for magnitude
let magnitude = outputs[1].value * this.maxforce;
// Create and apply the force
let force = p5.Vector.fromAngle(angle).setMag(magnitude);
this.applyForce(force);</pre>
<p>The neural network brain outputs two values; one for the angle of the vector, one for the magnitude. You might think to use these outputs for the vector’s <span data-type="equation">x</span> and <span data-type="equation">y</span> components. However, the default output range for an ml5 neural network is between 0 and 1. I want the forces to be capable of pointing in both positive and negative directions! Mapping an angle offers the full range.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that the code includes a variable called <code>inputs</code> that I have yet to declare or initialize. Defining the inputs to the neural network is where you as the designer of the system can be the most creative, and consider the simulated biology and capabilities of your creatures.</p>
<p>As a first try, I’ll assign something very basic for the inputs and see if it works. Since the Smart Rockets environment is static, with fixed obstacles and targets, what if the brain could learn and estimate a "flow field" to navigate towards its goal? A flow field receives a position and returns a vector, so the neural network can mirror this functionality and use the rocket's position as input (normalizing the x and y values according to the canvas dimensions).</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">let inputs = [this.position.x / width, this.position.y / height];</pre>
<p>That’s it! Everything else from the original example can remain unchanged: the population, the fitness function, and the selection process. The only other small adjustment is to use ml5.js’s <code>crossover()</code> and <code>mutate()</code> functions, eliminating the need for a separate <code>DNA</code> class with implementations of these steps.</p>

<p><strong>EXERCISE: something about desired vs. steering and using the velocity as inputs also</strong></p>
<h3 id="a-changing-world-1">A Changing World</h3>
<p>In the Smart Rockets example, the environment was static. This made the rocket's task of finding the target easy to accomplish using only its position as input. However, what if the target and the obstacles in the rocket's path were moving? To handle a more complex and changing environment, I need to expand the neural network's inputs and consider additional "features" of the environment. This is similar to what I did with Flappy Bird, where I identified the key data points of the environment to guide the bird's decision-making process.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the simplest version of this scenario, almost identical to the Smart Rockets, but removing obstacles and replacing the fixed target with a random “perlin noise” walker. In this world, I’ll rename the <code>Rocket</code> to <code>Creature</code> and write a new <code>Glow</code> class to represent a gentle, drifting orb. Imagine that the creature’s goal is to reach the light source and dance in its radiant embrace as long as it can.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">class Glow {
  constructor() {
    //{!2} Two different perlin noise offsets
    this.xoff = 0;
    this.yoff = 1000;
    this.position = createVector();
    this.r = 24;
  }

  update() {
    //{!2} Assign the position according to Perlin noise
    this.position.x = noise(this.xoff) * width;
    this.position.y = noise(this.yoff) * height;
    //{!2} Move along the perlin noise space
    this.xoff += 0.01;
    this.yoff += 0.01;
  }

  show() {
    stroke(0);
    strokeWeight(2);
    fill(200);
    circle(this.position.x, this.position.y, this.r * 2);
  }
}</pre>
<p>As the glow moves, the creature should take the glow’s position into account, as an input to its brain. However, it is not sufficient to know only the light’s position; it’s the position relative to the creature’s own that is key. A nice way to synthesize this information as an input feature is to calculate a vector that points from the creature to the glow. Here is where I can reinvent the <code>seek()</code> method from Chapter 5 using a neural network to estimate the steering force.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  seek(target) {
    //{!1} Calculate a vector from the position to the target
    let v = p5.Vector.sub(target, this.position);</pre>
<p>This is a good start, but the components of the vector do not fall within a normalized input range. I could divide <code>v.x</code> by <code>width</code> and <code>v.y</code> by <code>height</code>, but since my canvas is not a perfect square, it may skew the data. Another solution is to normalize the vector, but with that, I would lose any measure of the distance to the glow itself. After all, if the creature is sitting on top of the glow, it should steer differently than if it were very far away. There are multiple approaches I could take here. I’ll go with saving the distance in a separate variable before normalizing and plan to use it as an additional input feature.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  seek(target) {
    let v = p5.Vector.sub(target, this.position);
    // Save the distance in a variable (one input)
    let distance = v.mag();
    // Normalize the vector pointing from position to target (two inputs)
    v.normalize();</pre>
<p>Now, if you recall, a key element of Reynolds’ steering formula involves comparing the desired velocity to the current velocity. How the vehicle is currently moving plays a significant role in how it should steer! For the creature to consider its own velocity as part of its decision-making, I can include the velocity vector in the inputs as well. To normalize these values, it works beautifully to divide the vector’s components by the <code>maxspeed</code> property. This retains both the direction and magnitude of the vector. The rest of the code follows the same with the output of the neural network synthesized into a force to be applied to the creature.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  seek(target) {
    let v = p5.Vector.sub(target.position, this.position);
    let distance = v.mag();
    v.normalize();
    // Compiling the features into an inputs array
    let inputs = [
      v.x,
      v.y,
      distance / width,
      this.velocity.x / this.maxspeed,
      this.velocity.y / this.maxspeed,
    ];
    //{!5} Predicting the force to apply
    let outputs = this.brain.predictSync(inputs);
    let angle = outputs[0].value * TWO_PI;
    let magnitude = outputs[1].value;
    let force = p5.Vector.fromAngle(angle).setMag(magnitude);
    this.applyForce(force);
  }</pre>
<p>Enough has changed here from the rockets that it is also worth reconsidering the fitness function. Previously, fitness was calculated based on the rocket's distance from the target at the end of each generation. However, since this new target is moving, I prefer to accumulate the amount of time the creature is able to catch the glow as the measure of fitness. This can be achieved by checking the distance between the creature and the glow in the <code>update()</code> method and incrementing a <code>fitness</code> value when they are intersecting. Both the <code>Glow</code> and <code>Creature</code> class include a radius property <code>r</code> which can be used to determine collision.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  update(target) {
    //{inline} the usual updating of position, velocity, accleration

    //{!4} Increase the fitness whenever the creature reaches the glow
    let d = p5.Vector.dist(this.position, target.position);
    if (d &#x3C; this.r + target.r) {
      this.fitness++;
    }
  }</pre>
<p>Now, one thing you may have noticed about these examples is that testing them requires a delightful exercise in patience as you watch the slow crawl of the simulation play out generation after generation. This is part of the point—I want to watch the process! It’s also a nice excuse to take a break, which is to be encouraged. Head outside, enjoy some non-simulated nature, perhaps a small cup of soothing tea while you wait? Take comfort in the fact that you only have to wait billions of milliseconds rather than the billions of years required for actual biology.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for the system to evolve, there’s no inherent requirement that you draw and animate the world. Hundreds of generations could be completed in the blink of an eye if you could skip all that time spent rendering the scene.</p>
<p>One way to avoid tearing your hair out every time you change a small parameter and find yourself waiting what seems like hours to see if it had any effect is to render the environment, well, <em>less often</em>. In other words, you can compute multiple simulation steps per <code>draw()</code> cycle with a <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<p>Here is where I can make use of one of my favorite features of p5.js: the ability to quickly create standard interface elements. You saw this before in the interactive selection example from Chapter 10 with <code>createButton()</code>. In the following code, a "range" slider is used to control the skips in time. Only the code for the new time slider is shown here, excluding all the other global variables and their initializations in <code>setup()</code>. Remember, you will also need to separate the code for visuals from the physics to ensure that rendering still occurs only once.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">//{!1} A variable to hold the slider
let timeSlider;

function setup() {
  //{!1} Creating the slider with a min and max range, and starting value
  timeSlider = createSlider(1, 20, 1);
}

function draw() {
	//{!5} All of the drawing code happening just once!
  background(255);
  glow.show();
  for (let creature of creatures) {
    creature.show();
  }
  
	//{!8} All of the simulation code running multiple times according to the slider
  for (let i = 0; i &#x3C; timeSlider.value(); i++) {
    for (let creature of creatures) {
      creature.seek(glow);
      creature.update(glow);
    }
    glow.update();
    lifeCounter++;
  }
}</pre>
<p>In p5.js, a slider is defined with three arguments: a minimum value (for when the slider is all the way to the left), a maximum value (for when the slider is all the way to the right), and a starting value (for when the page first loads). This allows the simulation to run at 20X speed to reach the results of evolution more quickly, then slow back down to bask in the glory of the intelligent behaviors on display. Here is the final version of the example with a new<code>Creature</code> constructor to create a neural network. Everything else has remained the same from the Flappy Bird example code.</p>

<h3 id="neuroevolution-ecosystem-1">Neuroevolution Ecosystem</h3>
<p>If I’m being honest here, this chapter is getting kind of long. My goodness, this book is incredibly long, are you really still here reading? I’ve been working on it for over ten years and right now, at this very moment as I type these letters, I feel like stopping. But I cannot. I will not. There is one more thing I must demonstrate, that I am obligated to, that I won’t be able to tolerate skipping. So bear with me just a little longer. I hope it will be worth it.</p>
<p>There are two key elements of what I’ve demonstrated so far that don’t fit into my dream of the Ecosystem Project that has been the through-line of this book. The first is something I covered in chapter 9 with the introduction of the bloops—a system of creatures that all lives and dies together, starting completely over with each subsequent generation, is not how the biological world works! I’d like to also examine this in the context of neuroevolution.</p>
<p>But even more so, there’s a major flaw in the way I am extracting features from a scene. The creatures in Example 10.6 are all knowing. They know exactly where the glow is regardless of how far away they are or what might be blocking their vision or senses. Yes, it may be reasonable to assume they are aware of their current velocity, but I didn’t introduce any limits to the perception of external elements in their environment.</p>
<p>A common approach in reinforcement learning simulations is to attach sensors to an agent. For example, consider a simulated mouse in a maze searching for cheese in the dark. Its whiskers might act as proximity sensors to detect walls and turns. The mouse can’t see the entire maze, only its immediate surroundings. Another example is a bat using echolocation to navigate, or a car on a winding road that can only see what is projected in front of its headlights.</p>
<p>I’d like to build on this idea of the whiskers (or more formally the “vibrissae”) found in mice, cats, and other mammals. In the real world, animals use their vibrissae to navigate and detect nearby objects, especially in dark or obscured environments.</p>

<p>I’ll keep the generic class name <code>Creature</code> but think of them now as the circular “bloops” of chapter 9, enhanced with whisker-like sensors that emanate from their center in all directions.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">class Creature {
  constructor(x, y) {
    // The creature has a position and radius
    this.position = createVector(x, y);
    this.r = 16;
    // The creature has an array of sensors
    this.sensors = [];
	
    // The creature has a 5 sensors
    let totalSensors = 5;
    for (let i = 0; i &#x3C; totalSensors; i++) {
      // First, calculate a direction for the sensor 
      let angle = map(i, 0, totalSensors, 0, TWO_PI);
      // Create a vector a little bit longer than the radius as the sensor
      this.sensors[i] = p5.Vector.fromAngle(angle).mult(this.r * 1.5);
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>The code creates a series of vectors that each describe the direction and length of one “whisker” sensor attached to the creature. However, just the vector is not enough. I want the sensor to include a <code>value</code>, a numeric representation of what it is sensing. This <code>value</code> can be thought of as analogous to the intensity of touch. Just as a cat's whisker might detect a faint touch from a distant object or a stronger push from a closer one, the virtual sensor's value could range to represent proximity. Let’s assume there is a <code>Food</code> class to describe a circle of deliciousness that the creature wants to find.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">class Food {
  //{!4} A piece of food has a random position and fixed radius
  constructor() {
    this.position = createVector(random(width), random(height));
    this.r = 50;
  }

  show() {
    noStroke();
    fill(0, 100);
    circle(this.position.x, this.position.y, this.r * 2);
  }
}</pre>
<p>A <code>Food</code> object is a circle drawn according to a position and radius. I’ll assume the creature in my simulation has no vision and relies on sensors to detect if there is food nearby. This begs the question: how can I determine if a sensor is touching the food? One approach is to use a technique called “raycasting.” This method is commonly employed in computer graphics to project rays (often representing light) from an origin point in a scene to determine what objects they intersect with. Raycasting is useful for visibility and collision checks, exactly what I am doing here!</p>
<p>Although raycasting is a robust solution, it requires more involved mathematics than I'd like to delve into here. For those interested, an explanation and implementation are available in Coding Challenge #145 on <a href="http://thecodingtrain.com/">thecodingtrain.com</a>. For the example now, I will opt for a more straightforward approach and check whether the endpoint of a sensor lies inside the food circle.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/11_nn_ga/11_nn_ga_5.jpg" alt="Figure 10.x: Endpoint of sensor is inside or outside of the food based on distance to center of food.">
  <figcaption>Figure 10.x: Endpoint of sensor is inside or outside of the food based on distance to center of food.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As I want the sensor to store a value for its sensing along with the sensing algorithm itself, it makes sense to encapsulate these elements into a <code>Sensor</code> class.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">class Sensor {
  constructor(v) {
    this.v = v.copy();
    //{!1} The sensor also stores a value for the proximity of what it is sensing
    this.value = 0;
  }
  
  sense(position, food) {
    //{!1} Find the "tip" (or endpoint) of the sensor by adding position
    let end = p5.Vector.add(position, this.v);
    //{!1} How far is it from the food center
    let d = end.dist(food.position);
    //{!1} If it is within the radius light up the sensor  
    if (d &#x3C; food.r) {
      //{!1} The further into the center the food, the more the sensor activates
      this.value = map(d, 0, food.r, 1, 0);
    } else {
      this.value = 0;
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>Notice how the sensing mechanism gauges how deep inside the food’s radius the endpoint is with the <code>map()</code> function. When the sensor's endpoint is just touching the outer boundary of the food, the <code>value</code> starts at 0. As the endpoint moves closer to the center of the food, the value increases, maxing out at 1. If the sensor isn't touching the food at all, its value remains at 0. This gradient of feedback mirrors the varying intensity of touch or pressure in the real world.</p>
<p>Let’s look at testing the sensors with one bloop (controlled by the mouse) and one piece of food (placed at the center of the canvas). When the sensors touch the food, they light up and get brighter the closer to the center.</p>

class Creature {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.position = createVector(x, y);
    this.r = 16;

    //{!8} Create the sensors for the creature
    this.sensors = [];
    let totalSensors = 15;
    for (let i = 0; i &#x3C; totalSensors; i++) {
      let a = map(i, 0, totalSensors, 0, TWO_PI);
      let v = p5.Vector.fromAngle(a);
      v.mult(this.r * 2);
      this.sensors[i] = new Sensor(v);
    }
  }
	
  //{!4} Call the sense() method for each sensor
  sense(food) {
    for (let i = 0; i &#x3C; this.sensors.length; i++) {
      this.sensors[i].sense(this.position, food);
    }
  }

  //{inline} see book website for the drawing code
}</pre>
<p>Are you thinking what I’m thinking? What if the values of those sensors are the inputs to a neural network?! Assuming I bring back all of the necessary physics bits in the <code>Creature</code> class, I could write a new <code>think()</code> method that processes the sensor values through the neural network “brain” and outputs a steering force, just as with the previous two examples.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  think() {
    // Build an input array from the sensor values
    let inputs = [];
    for (let i = 0; i &#x3C; this.sensors.length; i++) {
      inputs[i] = this.sensors[i].value;
    }

    // Predicting a steering force from the sensors
    let outputs = this.brain.predictSync(inputs);
    let angle = outputs[0].value * TWO_PI;
    let magnitude = outputs[1].value;
    let force = p5.Vector.fromAngle(angle).setMag(magnitude);
    this.applyForce(force);
  }</pre>
<p>The logical next step would be incorporate all the usual parts of the genetic algorithm, writing a fitness function (how much food did each creature eat?) and performing selection after a fixed generation time period. But this is a great opportunity to test out the principles of a ”continuous” ecosystem with a more sophisticated environment and set of potential behaviors for the creatures themselves.</p>
<p>Instead of a fixed lifespan cycle for the population, I will introduce the concept of <code>health</code> for each one. For every cycle through <code>draw()</code> that a creature lives, the health deteriorates.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">class Creature {  
  constructor() {
    //{inline} All of the creature's properties
		
    // The health starts at 100
    this.health = 100;
  } 

  update() {
    //{inline} the usual updating position, velocity, acceleration

    // Losing some health!
    this.health -= 0.25;
  }</pre>
<p>Now in <code>draw()</code>, if any bloop’s health drops below zero, it dies and is deleted from the array. And for reproduction, instead of performing the usual crossover and mutation all at once, each bloop (with a health grader than zero) will have a 0.1% chance of reproducing.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  function draw() {
    for (let i = bloops.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (bloops[i].health &#x3C; 0) {
        bloops.splice(i, 1);
      } else if (random(1) &#x3C; 0.001) {
        let child = bloops[i].reproduce();
        bloops.push(child);
      }
    }
  }</pre>
<p>This methodology will lose the <code>crossover()</code> functionality and instead use the <code>copy()</code> method. The reproductive process in this case is cloning rather than mating. A higher mutation rate isn’t always ideal but it will help introduce additional variation without the mixing of weights. However, I encourage you to consider ways that you could also incorporate crossover.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  reproduce() {
    //{!2} copy and mutate rather than crossover and mutate
    let brain = this.brain.copy();
    brain.mutate(0.1);
    return new Creature(this.position.x, this.position.y, brain);
  }</pre>
<p>Now, for this to work, some bloops should live longer than others. By consuming food, their health increases giving them a boost of time to reproduce. I’ll manage in this an <code>eat()</code> method of the <code>Creature</code> class.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  eat(food) {
    // If the bloop is close to the food, increase its health!
    let d = p5.Vector.dist(this.position, food.position);
    if (d &#x3C; this.r + food.r) {
      this.health += 0.5;
    }
  }</pre>
<p>Is this enough for the system to evolve and find its equilibrium? I could dive deeper, tweaking parameters and behaviors in pursuit of the ultimate evolutionary system. The allure of the infinite rabbit hole is one I cannot easily escape. I will do that on my own time and for the purpose of this book, invite you to run the example, experiment, and draw your own conclusions.</p>

      bloops[i].think();
      bloops[i].eat();
      bloops[i].update();
      bloops[i].borders();
      if (bloops[i].health &#x3C; 0) {
        bloops.splice(i, 1);
      } else if (random(1) &#x3C; 0.001) {

  for (let treat of food) {
    treat.show();
  }
  for (let bloop of bloops) {
    bloop.show();
  }

<p>The final example also includes a few additional features that you’ll find in the accompanying code such as an array of food that shrinks as it gets eaten (re-spawning when it is depleted). Additionally, the bloops shrink as their health deteriorates.</p>
