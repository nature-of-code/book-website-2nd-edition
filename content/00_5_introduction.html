<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-this-book">What is this book?</h2>
<p>Over a decade ago, I self-published “The Nature of Code”, an online resource and print book with a goal of exploring the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software, specifically the creative coding framework Processing. It’s the understatement of the century to say that much has changed in the world of technology and creative media since then. And yet, a bird still flaps its wings and broccoli still tastes like broccoli. So here I am, again, with a new and rebooted version of this book. Sure, there’s a few new tricks, but it’s the same old nature.</p>
<p>At ITP/IMA (Tisch School of the Arts, New York University), I’ve been teaching a course entitled Introduction to Computational Media since 2004. This origins of this class date back to 1987 and the work of Mike Mills and John Henry Thompson (inventor of the Lingo programming language.) In the course, students learn the basics of programming (variables, conditionals, loops, objects, arrays) as well as a survey of applications related to making interactive media projects (pixels, data, sound, networking, 3D, and more.) In 2008, I synthesized my materials for this class into an introductory book <em>Learning Processing</em>, and in 2015 I created a series of video tutorials that follow the same trajectory in JavaScript with the p5.js library.</p>
<p><em>The Nature of Code</em> course (also taught at ITP and IMA since 2008) serves as a follow-up to that introduction. Once a student has learned the basics and seen an array of applications, their next step might be to delve deeply into a particular area. Maybe they want to focus on computer vision or data visualization? Generative poetry? This book is just one possible next step in a world of many. It picks up exactly where my introductory material leaves off, demonstrating a world of programming techniques that focus on algorithms and simulation.</p>
<p>My goal for this book is simple. I want to take a look at something that naturally occurs in the physical world, and figure out how to write code to simulate that occurrence.</p>
<p>What then is this book exactly? Is it a science book? The answer is a resounding no. True, I might examine topics that come from physics or biology, but I am not taking on the role of investigating these topics with a particularly high level of academic rigor. Instead, the book is “inspired by actual events,” I’m grabbing the parts from science and mathematics needed to build a software interpretation of nature, and veering off course or skipping details as I see fit.</p>
<p>Is this an art or design book? I would also say no; regardless of how informal my approach might be, I am in fact putting my focus on algorithms and their affiliated programming techniques. Sure, the resulting demonstrations are visual in nature (manifested as animated p5.js sketches), but they will exist as literal visualizations of the algorithms and programming techniques themselves, drawn only with basic shapes and grayscale color. It is my hope, however, that you, dear reader, can bring your creativity and visual ideas to make new, engaging work. (I won’t complain if you turn every example into a rainbow.)</p>
<p>In the end, if this book is anything, it is an old-fashioned programming textbook. While a scientific topic may seed a chapter (Newtonian physics, cellular growth, evolution) or the results might inspire an artistic project, the content itself will always boil down to the code implementation, with a particular focus on object-oriented programming.</p>
<h2 id="a-word-about-p5js">A word about p5.js</h2>
<p>I am using p5.js in this book for a number of reasons. For one, it’s an environment that I am very familiar with. While the original Processing built on top of Java is my first love and still what I turn to when trying out a new idea, p5.js is what I use for teaching many of my programming classes in the year of 2023. It’s free, open-source, well suited to beginners, and everything runs right there in the web browser itself.</p>
<p>For me, however, Processing and p5.js are first and foremost a community of people, not coding libraries or frameworks. Those people have generously dedicated countless hours making and sharing the software. I’ve written this book for that community and for anyone and everyone who loves to explore their curiosity and play through code.</p>
<p>All that said, there is nothing that ties what I am doing in this book strictly to p5.js or Processing, for that matter. This book could have been written with “vanilla” JavaScript, “vanilla” Java, or any number of other open-source “creative coding” environments like openFrameworks, Cinder, and so on. It is my hope that after I’ve completed this book, I’ll be able to release versions of the examples that run in other environments. If anyone is interested in helping to port the examples, please feel free to contact me (<code>daniel@shiffman.net</code>). Go on, you know you want to port the Nature of Code to PHP!</p>
<p>All of the examples in this book have been tested with p5.js v1.7.0, but for the most part, they should also work with earlier versions of p5.js. I’ll be keeping them up-to-date with whatever the latest version is. The most recent code can always be found on this book’s website (and its associated GitHub repository.)</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-need-to-know">What do you need to know?</h2>
<p>The prerequisite for understanding the material in this book could be stated as: “one semester of programming instruction with p5.js, Processing, or any other creative coding environment (including familiarity with object-oriented programming).” That said, there’s no reason why you couldn’t read this book having learned programming using a different language or development environment.</p>
<p>If you’ve never written any code before, while you could read the book for the concepts and inspiration, you will likely struggle with the code because I will assume knowledge of the fundamentals: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, objects, and arrays. If these concepts are new to you, my “Code! Programming with p5.js” or “Introduction to Creative Coding with Processing 4” video courses on YouTube (found on the “tracks” page of <em>thecodingtrain.com</em>) provide the fundamentals of what you need to know.</p>
<p>If you are an experienced programmer, but haven’t worked with p5.js, you can probably pick it up by <a href="https://p5js.org/">checking out the p5.js documentation</a>, poking through the examples, and reading through the <a href="https://p5js.org/get-started/">Getting Started</a> page.</p>
<p>I should also point out that experience with object-oriented programming is fairly critical. I’ll review some of the basics in Chapter 0, but if classes and objects are unfamiliar to you, I would suggest watching my p5.js or Processing object-oriented video tutorials, both available also at <em>thecodingtrain.com</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-you-using-to-read-this-book">What are you using to read this book?</h2>
<p>Are you reading this book on a Kindle? Printed paper? On your laptop in PDF form? On a tablet showing an animated HTML5 version? Are you strapped to a chair, absorbing the content directly into your brain via a series of electrodes, tubes, and cartridges?</p>
<p>The print edition of what you are reading right now was generated with <a href="https://github.com/magicbookproject/">Magic Book project</a>. The Magic Book is an open-source framework for self-publishing originally developed at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/">ITP</a>, also well over 10 years ago. My dream has always been to write the book in one single format. In this case, it was a collection of Notion documents. Then, after pressing a magic button (<code>npm run build</code>), out comes the book in a variety of formats—PDF, HTML5, printed hardcopy, Kindle, and so on, and so forth. Everything could be designed and styled using CSS, no manual typesetting or layout. The reality of putting this book together isn’t so clean and the story of how that happened is long. If you are interested in learning more, make sure you read all of my thank yous in the acknowledgements and go and hire those people to help you publish a book! Also, I’ll include more details in the associated GitHub repository at the “nature-of-code” GitHub organization pages.</p>
<h2 id="choo-choo-choose-your-medium">Choo-Choo-Choose Your Medium</h2>
<p>Personally, I still love an assembled amalgamation of cellulose pulp, meticulously bound together with a resilient spine, upon which pigmented compounds have been artfully deployed to convey words and ideas. Yet, ever since 2012, when I impulsively recorded my very first video lesson about programming in my office at ITP, I have discovered that there is tremendous value and joy in conveying ideas and lessons through motion pictures.</p>
<p>All this is to say, I have a YouTube channel. It’s called the Coding Train. I just mentioned it a couple of sections ago when discussing options for learning the prerequisite material for this book, in case it is unfamiliar to you. If you continue reading, you’ll find I continue to reference related videos. A lot. I might allude to one I made about related algorithm or alternative technique for a particular coding example, or suggest a series on a tangential concept that could provide additional context to a topic I’m exploring.</p>
<p>I’m also working on an accompanying set of video tutorials that follow the exact same material of this book. I made a whole bunch 10 years ago with Processing and more recently, I started publishing a series of updated ones. At the time of this writing, I’m about half way through Chapter 5.</p>
<p>All this said, there is an abundance of exceptional educational material that I did not write or record out there teaching simulation and generative algorithms. I always recommend that you explore various perspectives and voices when attempting to learn something new. It’s possible that what I’ve written might not click with you and even hearing me repeat the same information in video form, regardless of how much mugging I do for the camera, won’t help. Sometimes what’s best is someone else you can related to writing or saying or demonstrating the same things in different words with a different style. To this end, I am including a “further reading and watching” section on this book’s website. If you create your own materials or have any recommendations for inclusion, please get in touch!</p>
<p>Two quick recommendations I have right now are <em>The Computational Beauty of Nature</em> by Gary William Flake (1998)—it’s where I originally learned a lot of the ideas inside this book—and the superbly organized online resource <em>That Creative Code Page</em> by Taru Muhonen and Raphaël de Courville.</p>
<h2 id="the-story-of-this-book">The “story” of this book</h2>
<p>If you glance over the book’s table of contents, you’ll notice there are twelve chapters (0-11!), each one covering a different topic. And in one sense, this book is just that—a survey of a dozen concepts and associated code examples. Nevertheless, in putting together the material, I always imagined something of a linear narrative. Before you begin reading, I’d like to walk you through this story.</p>
<h3 id="part-1-inanimate-objects">Part 1: Inanimate objects</h3>
<p>A soccer ball lies in the grass. A kick launches it into the air. Gravity pulls it back down. A heavy gust of wind keeps it afloat a moment longer until it falls and bounces off the head of a jumping player. The soccer ball is not alive; it makes no choices as to how it will move throughout the world. Rather, it is an inanimate object waiting to be pushed and pulled by the forces of its environment.</p>
<p>How would you model a soccer ball moving in a digital canvas? If you’ve ever programmed a circle moving across a screen, then you’ve probably written the following line of code.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">x = x + 1;</pre>
<p>You draw some shape at position <code>x</code>. With each frame of animation, you increment the value of <code>x</code>, redraw the shape and voila—the illusion of motion! Maybe you took it a step or two further, and included a <code>y</code> position, as well as variables for speed along the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axes.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">x = x + xspeed;
y = y + yspeed;</pre>
<p>Part I of this story will take you a step further. I’m going to take these variables <code>xspeed</code> and <code>yspeed</code> and demonstrate how together they form a vector (<strong>Chapter 1</strong>), the building block of motion. I won’t get any new functionality out of this, but it will build a solid foundation for the rest of the book.</p>
<p>Once you know a little something about vectors, you are going to quickly realize that a force (<strong>Chapter 2</strong>) is a vector. Kick a soccer ball and you are applying a force. What does a force cause an object to do? According to Isaac Newton, force equals mass times acceleration. That force causes an object to accelerate. Modeling forces will allow you to create systems with dynamic motion where objects move according to a variety of rules.</p>
<p>Now, that soccer ball to which you applied a force might have also been spinning. If an object moves according to its acceleration, it can spin according to its angular acceleration (<strong>Chapter 3</strong>). Understanding the basics of angles and trigonometry will allow you to model rotating objects as well as grasp the principles behind oscillating motion, like a pendulum swinging or a spring bouncing.</p>
<p>Once you’ve tackled the basics of motion and forces for an individual inanimate object, I’ll demonstrate how to make thousands upon thousands of those objects and manage them in a single thing called a particle system (<strong>Chapter 4</strong>). Particle systems are also a good excuse to look at some additional features of object-oriented programming, namely inheritance and polymorphism.</p>
<h3 id="part-2-its-alive">Part 2: It’s alive!</h3>
<p>What does it mean to model life? Not an easy question to answer, but I will begin by building objects that have an ability to perceive their environment. Let’s think about this for a moment. A block that falls off a table moves according to forces, as does a dolphin swimming through the water. But there is a key difference. The block cannot decide to leap off that table. The dolphin can, however, decide to leap out of the water. The dolphin has dreams and desires. It feels hunger or fear, and those feelings inform its movements. By examining techniques behind modeling autonomous agents (<strong>Chapter 5</strong>), you will learn to breathe life into inanimate objects, allowing them to make decisions about their movements according to their understanding of their environment.</p>
<p>In Chapters 1 through 5, all of the examples will be written from “scratch”—meaning the code for the algorithms driving the motion of the objects will be written directly in p5.js. I’m certainly not the first programmer ever to consider the idea of simulating physics and life in animation, so next I’ll examine how physics libraries (<strong>Chapter 6</strong>) can be used to model more sophisticated behaviors. I’ll look at Matter.js and the <a href="http://toxiclibs.org/">toxiclibs.js verlet physics</a>.</p>
<p>The end of Chapter 5 will explore group behaviors that exhibit the properties of complexity. A complex system is typically defined as a system that is “more than the sum of its parts.” While the individual elements of the system may be incredibly simple and easily understood, the behavior of the system as a whole can be highly complex, intelligent, and difficult to predict. This will lead you away from thinking purely about modeling motion and into the realm of rule-based systems. What can you model with cellular automata (<strong>Chapter 7</strong>), a system of cells living on a grid? What types of patterns can be generated with fractals (<strong>Chapter 8</strong>), the geometry of nature?</p>
<h3 id="part-3-intelligence">Part 3: Intelligence</h3>
<p>You made things move. Then you gave those things hopes and dreams and fears, along with rules to live by. The last step in this book will bring intelligent decision making into your creations. Can you apply the biological process of evolution to computational systems (<strong>Chapter 9</strong>) in order to evolve the behavior of autonomous agents? Taking inspiration from the human brain, can you program an artificial neural network (<strong>Chapter 10</strong>)? How can those agents make decisions, learn from their mistakes, and adapt to their environment (<strong>Chapter 11)</strong>?</p>
<h2 id="this-book-as-a-syllabus">This book as a syllabus</h2>
<p>While the content in this book certainly makes for an intense and highly compressed semester, I have designed it to fit into a fourteen-week course. Nevertheless, it’s worth mentioning that I find that some chapters work better expanded across multiple weeks. While not ideal, some can also be combined and explored together. Here’s one possible syllabus:</p>

<h3 id="code-examples">Code Examples</h3>
<p>Each chapter includes fully functional code examples that are written with the p5.js library. Here’s what they look like:</p>
<div data-type="example">
  <h3 id="example--example-title">Example #.#: Example Title</h3>
  <figure>
    <div data-type="embed" data-p5-editor="https://editor.p5js.org/natureofcode/sketches/oadKdOndU" data-example-path="examples/00_5_introduction/example_1_1_bouncing_ball_with_no_vectors"><img src="examples/00_5_introduction/example_1_1_bouncing_ball_with_no_vectors/screenshot.png"></div>
    <figcaption></figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">function setup() {
  // This canvas size is used to accomodate the book's layout but is not critical for the examples otherwise.
  createCanvas(640, 240);
  background(255);
}

function draw() {
  fill(0, 25);
  stroke(0, 50);
  // Draw a random circle each time through draw
  circle(random(width),random(height), 16)
}</pre>
<p>Each example is numbered to help you find the corresponding code. In the printed version of the book, you'll find a screenshot right below the example title. The online version, on the other hand, has the sketch running embedded on the page. For animated examples (which are almost all of them), the screenshots will often show a "trail" of motion. This effect was achieved by adding transparency to the <code><strong>background(255, 10)</strong></code> function, though the accompanying code won't include that enhancement.</p>
<p>Below the example you’ll find the code, but it is not always the <em>complete </em>code. Since many examples are quite long, I make my best effort to include a snippet that highlights the main aspects of the example or whatever new components are being introduced. You can find the full version of the code on the book's website. There, you can interact with, modify, and experiment with the code in the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/natureofcode/sketches/u4vTwZuhT">p5.js Web Editor</a>. Additionally, everything is included in the book's GitHub repository. Here are the full URLs to access all of the materials:</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="code-exercises">Code Exercises</h3>
<p>Each chapter also includes numbered exercises which serve as your playground to apply, experiment, and go beyond the concepts and codes provided within the chapters. Here’s what an exercise might look like:</p>
<div data-type="exercise">
  <h3 id="exercise-">Exercise #.#</h3>
  <p>Try tweaking Example #.# so that each circle shows off a random size.</p>
  <pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">function draw() {
  fill(0, 25);
  stroke(0, 50);
  circle(random(width),random(height), <span class="blank">random(16, 64)</span>);
}</pre>
</div>
<p>Keeping you on your toes, the exercises come in a variety of formats! Some pose technical challenges, asking you to write a variation of a specific algorithm or solve a highly specific challenge. Others are open-ended inquiries, prompting you to play and experiment, following your own ideas. Some include snippets of code with blank spots, inviting you to fill them in directly. Don’t hesitate to write, scribble, or doodle in this very book as you work through them!</p>
<p>Solutions for the exercises are provided on the book's website. Or I should say, I aspire to eventually include solutions for all of the exercises on the book’s website. As of this moment, there are just a handful, but hopefully by the time you are reading this there will be many more. If you'd like to contribute a solution to an exercise, I would love for you to do so via the book’s GitHub repository!</p>
<h3 id="code-snippets">Code Snippets</h3>
<p>Code is the main medium of this book, weaving throughout the narrative, sometimes appearing as a full, standalone example, other times dropping in as a single line or two. It’s part of text, dissected and examined, stretching over sections with explanations nestled in between. Here’s a quick guide on how to navigate the code snippets sprinkled throughout the book.</p>
<p><strong>Complete Snippets!</strong></p>
<p>Though rare, there are sometimes “complete” sections of code. Sometimes, like with the sample “Example #.#” in the previous section, I might actually list all of the code associated with a complete p5.js sketch. However, for most cases, I’m considering a “complete snippet” to be the complete code for an entire function or a class, a fully finished “block of code.” Something like:</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">// The entire draw() function for an example
function draw() {
  background(255);
  for (let x = 0; x &#x3C; width; x += spacing) {
    fill(255);
    circle(x, height / 2, spacing);
  }
}</pre>
<p>The above represents everything that an example might include for the <code>draw()</code> function, but it still is not complete. It assumes the existence of a global variable called <code>spacing</code>, as well as a <code>setup()</code> function that called <code>createCanvas()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Context Free Code!</strong></p>
<p>Occasionally, you’ll find lines of code hanging out on the page without a surrounding function or context. These snippets are there to illustrate a point, not necessarily to be run as-is. They might represent a concept, a tiny piece of an algorithm, or a coding technique.</p>
<pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">   // RGB values to make the circles pink
   fill(240, 99, 164);</pre>
<p>Notice how the above “context free” snippet matches the indentation of <code>fill(255)</code> in the “complete snippet.” I’ll do this when some code has been established to be part of a something demonstrated previously. Admittedly, this won’t always work out so cleanly or perfectly, but I’m doing my best!</p>
<p><strong>✂️ Snipped Code!</strong></p>
<p>Be on the lookout the scissors! This design element indicates that a code snippet is a continuation of a previous piece or will be continued after some explanatory text. Sometimes, it’s not actually being continued, but is just cut-off because the rest of what would be written is not relevant for the discussion at hand. The scissors are there to say: "Hey, there's might be more to this code above or below or at the very least, this is a part of something bigger!" Here’s how this might play out.</p>
<p>The first step is to create a canvas.</p>
<div class="snip-below">
  <pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">function setup() {
  createCanvas(640, 240);
</pre>
</div>
<p>Then it’s time to draw the background.</p>
<div class="snip-above snip-below">
  <pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  background(255);</pre>
</div>
<p>I also like to include a circle in the center of the canvas.</p>
<div class="snip-above">
  <pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">  circle(width / 2, height /2, 200);
}</pre>
</div>
<p>In draw, I might want to start placing squares at random locations on top of the background and fixed circle. The rest of the code could be anything you want it to be!</p>
<div class="snip-below">
  <pre class="codesplit" data-code-language="javascript">function draw() {
  rectMode(CENTER);
  square(random(width), random(height), 20);</pre>
</div>
<p>Notice again how I’m keeping the indentation consistent to try to help establish the context and using the scissors icon to help indicate where code is continued or cut-off.</p>
<h2 id="the-ecosystem-project">The Ecosystem Project</h2>
<p>As much as I’d like to pretend you could learn everything by curling up in a comfy chair and reading some prose about programming, to learn programming, you’re really going to have to do some programming. You might find it helpful to keep in mind a project idea (or two) to develop as a set of exercises while going from chapter to chapter. In fact, when teaching the Nature of Code course at ITP, I have often found that students enjoy building a single project, step by step, week by week, over the course of a semester.</p>
<p>At the end of each chapter, you’ll find a series of exercises for one such project—exercises that build on each other, one topic at a time. Consider the following scenario. You’ve been asked by a science museum to develop the software for a new exhibit—The Digital Ecosystem, a world of animated, procedural creatures that live in a digital simulation for visitors to enjoy as they enter the museum. I don’t mean to suggest that this is a particularly innovative or creative concept. Rather, I’ll use this example project idea as a literal representation of the content in the book, demonstrating how the elements fit together in a single software project. I encourage you to develop your own idea, one that is perhaps more abstract and non-traditional in its thinking.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-i-find-the-code-online-and-submit-feedback">Where do I find the code online and submit feedback?</h2>
<p>For all things book-related, please visit the <a href="http://www.natureofcode.com/">Nature of Code website</a>: <strong><em>natureofcode.com</em></strong>. The raw source text of the book and all of the illustrations are on <a href="https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-book-2">GitHub</a> under the “nature-of-code” organization account. Please leave feedback and submit corrections using GitHub issues.</p>
<p>The source code for all of the examples (and exercises, well, I’m still working on finishing all exercise solutions) is also available on <a href="https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-examples-p5.js">GitHub</a>. The chapters themselves include code snippets in-line with the text. Remember, however, that in many cases, I have shortened or simplified the code snippets in order to illustrate a specific point. In all cases, the full code with comments can be found on the book website and GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-get-help">Where to get help?</h2>
<p>Coding can be tough, and frustrating, and the ideas in this book are not always straightforward. You don’t have to go it alone. There’s someone else reading right now who would love to co-organize a study group or a book club with friends to meet, chat, and share your struggles and successes? If you don’t find a local community to travel this journey together, what about an online one? Two places I would suggest are the official Processing forums (<em>discourse.processing.org</em>) and The Coding Train Discord server (<em>thecodingtrain.com/discord</em>).</p>
<p>More importantly, I want to see what you make! You can share your ideas by submitting to the passenger showcase on the Coding Train website, or in the channels on the aforementioned Discord. A hello in a YouTube comment is always welcome (although to be honest, it’s often best not to read the comments on YouTube), and feel free to tag me on whatever platform the future of social media has to offer! Whichever one is the friendliest and least toxic! I want to enjoy all the bloops that swim in your ecosystem, whether they leap triumphantly over a wave of creativity or a make a tiny splash in a pond of learning, let’s bask in the ripples they send through the nature of coding!</p>
